# kaiax/auction

This module is responsible for processing the auction specified by [KIP-249](https://kips.kaia.io/KIPs/kip-249).

## Concepts

The bid is a data that contains the information to generate a transaction to be executed right after the target transaction is executed.

Note that the bid comes from the `Auctioneer`, which is an independent service that is responsible for processing auction and submit winner's bid to the Kaia client (CN).

## Bid pool validation rules

A bid pool is responsible for managing the valid bids from the auctioneer. The bid must satisfy the following rules:

1. The `bid.BlockNumber` must be in range of `[currentBlockNumber + 1, currentBlockNumber + allowFutureBlock]`.
2. The `bid.Bid` must be greater than 0.
3. The `bid.Sender` must not be in the winner list of the same block number if the new bid isn't equal to the previous bid.
4. The `bid.SearcherSig` and `bid.AuctioneerSig` must be valid.

## Block building rules

Upon detection of target transaction from the tx pool, the following logics are executed:

- The corresponding bid is retrieved from the bid pool.
- If the bid is found, a new bundle is generated which contain `[BidTx]`.
- If the target transaction is not found in the bid pool, the bid will be ignored.

## Persistent schema

This module does not persist any data.

## Module lifecycle

### Init

- Dependencies:
  - ChainConfig: to generate the latest signer.
  - NodeKey: for BidTxGenerator.
- Notable dependents:
  - worker: to extract bundles.

### Start and stop

It starts/stops the bid pool and corresponding background threads.

## Block processing

### Execution

This module reads `SystemRegistry` and `AuctionEntryPoint` to detect any changes in `AuctionEntryPoint` and `Auctioneer` address. If the one of them is changed, the module will clear the existing bids in the bid pool.

## APIs

### auction_submitBid

Send a bid and get bid hash if successful, otherwise empty hash with error.

Go client can use `SendAuctionTx(Context, BidInput) (map[string]any, error)`, which is the same format with JSON RPC.
